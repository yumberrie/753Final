        <h2>Hello</h2><h2 class="sub">Welcome to my little site!</h2>
        <p>I’m Zoe, a library and information science student at Dominican University. This site is made for my course LIS 753: Internet Fundamentals.</p>
          <p>After graduating from Knox College in 2019, I spent a year at home, working at the local ice rink and volunteering at the public library. I had no idea what I was going to do, where I was going, anything at all. Then the pandemic hit. My work shut down. Volunteering shut down.</p>
          <p>After a couple of weeks, once everything sort of settled down, I realized what I missed most was the library. The people, the materials, the space. I decided to apply to Dominican University’s MLIS program. I was accepted, and took my first two classes that next fall, all online.</p>
